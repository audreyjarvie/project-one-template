Gregarious, chilled-out Gothenburg (Göteborg) is the quintessential 'second city': understatedly hip and unexpectedly vibrant. Neoclassical architecture lines its tram-rattled streets, locals sun themselves beside canals, and there's always an interesting cultural or social event going on. The city is eminently walkable. From Centralstationen in the north, retail-centric Östra Hamngatan leads southeast across one of Gothenburg’s 17th-century canals, through verdant Kungsparken (King’s Park) to the city’s boutique and upscale bar-lined ‘Avenyn’ (Kungsportsavenyn) boulevard. The waterfront abounds with all things nautical, from ships, aquariums and sea-related museums to the freshest fish. To the west, the Vasastan, Haga and Linné districts buzz with grassroots creativity and an appreciation for well-preserved history.
